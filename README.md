**HobbyLinux. Make More.**

HobbyLinux is a lightweight and easy-to-use GNU/Linux distribution designed for hobbyists!

The goal of the project is to provide a customizable operating system with tools and a user experience designed to maximize productivity by minimizing inefficiencies.

HobbyLinux is currently on **indefinite hiatus**. It as a functional (albeit minimal) cli installer but little more than that. During development I realized vanilla [ArchLinux](https://archlinux.org) was actually pretty good so I just stuck with that.
